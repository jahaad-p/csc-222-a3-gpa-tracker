- starting off by defining our private attributes. for acedemic honesty: ill only be refrencing zybooks and java documention via w3 schools for any blockers during the completion of the assignment. 

- Reviewed 9.1 for overview of objects and now i will reference 9.3 for the class defintion refrence. I am not able to recall java object syntax by memory just yet... ( OOP is new to me )

## 1:28Pm

- creating starter code file and commiting to git

## 1:34
- defined private atb. now for the constructor to init. student object. commiting changes before going forward and taking a eye rest for 5 minutes as i been at my desk for some time now.

- after reviewing 9.5: a constructor is called when an object is created and inits all the fields... so for my new student class: i should call ` public Student () { /* here lies assignment of values */ } `

- so from my understanding the private { data type } { reference name } is to declares the variables and define their type and the constructor that follows is what assigns values to the fields/ instance variables. Checking if my understanding is correct...

- it seems as so... one thing to note is that if a consturctor is not defined explicitly, Java automatically provides a default no-arg constructor. This default no arg constructor will look like ` public Student() { } `

## 2:09 

- time to apply this to our case... pre commiting and then getting to work

- commiting changes

## 2:22

- after reviewing what UML is: i noticed that it defines the constructor must not be a no -arg one as i've had it: while the pattern I was conceptualizing would give the same output: the required instruction would not be met resulting in points off on the assignment. I was defining default values ("undefined","undefined",-1) in the constructor instead of passing the private values.

- we are creating whats called a prameterized constructor, probably because we will call the class AFTER we take the users input... so we will have everything we need to populate the object.

commited changes, will return back and define our methods during our next session
